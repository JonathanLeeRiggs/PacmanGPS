# GPS
## Welcome to the GPS wiki!
We are two students that study this second year of Computer Science and Mathematics in the University Of Ariel, Israel. 
**In this page you will learn how to play/use our GPS pacman game.**

 This project is a game that is very easy to use and follow it's rules.

***

There can be as many fruits and pacman as you'll like to =and our algorithm is based on the greedy algorithm.
The closest fruit to any pacman is eaten and so on until there are no fruits left on the game board.
the paths will finally be shown on the game board.

The animation is used with one thread that controls the frequency of the pacman movements.

### **Second step:** 
Select in which mode you would like to play:
1.  Load mode-if you have .csv file that contains the data required for the game.

    select the "File" button on the menu bar and then click the "Load" button.

/"fruit"  ![fruit](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44787567/50399333-6059fb80-0787-11e9-9c27-64443f92497c.png) and place them on the game board.

### **Third step:** 

_Running the game:_ click 'options' --> 'run' and each pacman will eat the fruit in it's path.
the game is animated and will show you in near-real time the paths and the movement.

* **start flag** is the start point of the pacman. ![flag](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44787567/50423765-72f53300-0862-11e9-8f32-5a2e6ae399bb.png)

* **white dot** is a fruit in the path that was eaten. ![dot](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44787567/50423775-95874c00-0862-11e9-888e-2aa992a3f157.png)

### **Fourth step:** 
after each pacman finished it's path you now can decide what you want to do.

* saving your game to .kml file (that you can open and with google-map). go to 'File'-->'Path2kml'

*** 
_notice:_ in each step you can clean your game board (delete all your fruits and pacman) by click on 'File'-->'Clear'.
